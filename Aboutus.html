&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGreater Hyderabad is a mega city that covers 625 sq. km. of municipal corporation area and 6,852 sq. km. of metropolitan area. It is fast emerging as the hub ofnbspIT/ITES , Biotech, Pharma and Tourism sectors. Its strategic geographical location, multilingual and cosmopolitan culture, tremendous growth potential and investment-friendly economic policy are all making it an attractive destination for corporates, entrepreneurs, academicians and homemakers alike.

Its population stands at 8 million and is projected to touch 13.6 million by 2021.
Currently, over 3 million personalised vehicles ply on Hyerabad roads, with an addition of 0.20 million vehicles every year.
8 million motorised trips are made every day, of which, only about 3.2 million or 40% are made by the Public Transrtation System <font color="#2428FF"><b>(PTS)</b></font> i.e. buses and local trains. That means the rest of the trips are made by personal vehicles leading to traffic bottlenecks, high pollution levels and a steep inrease in fuel consumption.
A people-friendly city is that which provides a good quality of life. An efficient, safe, reliable and comfortable public transportation system is one of the pre-requisites of good living.
The inreasing pressure of the burgeoning population is putting Hyderabad's Transportation System under constant pressure. The need of the hour is a robust system that is dependable, comfortable, affordable and sustainable.
The answer lies in Mass Rapid Transit System <font color="#2428FF"><b>(MRTB)</b></font>. Accordingly, the development of Metro Rail was approved for 72 km., covering three high density traffic corridors of Hydeabad. The Project is being developed on <font color="#2428FF"><b>DBFOT</b></font> basis in PPP mode.
